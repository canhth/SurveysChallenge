# SurveysChallenge
### We are going to create a simple app to display list of surveys.

## Technical notes & Requirements: 
 - Swift version 4.2
 - Xcode 10.1
 - Use SwiftLint to enforce Swift style and conventions.
 - Using [MVVM-C](https://marcosantadev.com/mvvmc-with-swift/) pattern.
 
To be able to run this project, you need to install or have access to the following:

* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/man/bundle-install.1.html): A tool to manage the project's dependencies. To install Bundle, run the following command in your terminal:  `gem install bundler`.
* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/): A dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. To install Cocoapods, run the following command in your terminal:`sudo gem install cocoapods`

## Setup

Before running the project for the first time, run the following commands.

1.`bundle install` to install all gems listed in the gemfile.

2. `bundle exec pod install`  to install the necessary cocoapods required to build the project.

 ### Note: 
 - I'm not implement UITests here because it's too small.
 - If you wanna see more examples how I'm using RxSwift - MVVM, UITests... you can take a look what I've done at these links to see:
